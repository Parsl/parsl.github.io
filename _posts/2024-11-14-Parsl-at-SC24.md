### Parsl+CWL: Towards Combining the Python and CWL Ecosystems
<pre>🕣 Time: 11:21 – 11:44 a.m.   |   ℹ️ Event Type: Workshop   |   📍 Location: <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=20&location=rB302" target="_blank">B302</a>   |   🔗 <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=ws_worksp114&sess=sess756" target="_blank">More details</a>   </pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a widely adopted language for defining and sharing computational workflows. It is designed to be independent of the execution engine on which workflows are executed. Here, we describe our experiences integrating CWL with Parsl, a Python-based parallel programming library designed to manage execution of workflows across diverse computing environments.

We propose a new method that converts CWL CommandLineTool definitions into Parsl apps, enabling Parsl scripts to easily import and use tools represented in CWL. We describe a Parsl runner capable of executing a CWL CommandLineTool directly. We also describe a proof-of-concept extension to support inline Python in a CWL workflow definition, enabling seamless use in Parsl's Python ecosystem. We demonstrate benefits of this integration by presenting example CWL CommandLineTool definitions that show how they can be used in Parsl, and comparing performance of executing an image processing workflow using Parsl-CWL and other CWL runners.</p>

### Seesaw: Elastic Scaling for Task-Based Distributed Programs
<pre>🕔 Time: Noon – 5 p.m.   |   ℹ️ Event Type: Poster   |   📍 Location: <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=20&location=rB302-B305">B302-B305</a>   |   📝 Author: Matthew Chung, UC Riverside </pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Modern batch schedulers in HPC environments enable the shared use of available computational resources via provisioning discrete sets of resources matching user requirements. The lack of elasticity in such scenarios is often addressed using a Pilot job model where multiple separate requests are pooled. In this work, we explore computational elasticity in a popular Python-based workflow system: Parsl. We identify limitations in existing scaling logic and propose a new resource-aware scheduler. We show a significant improvement in the efficiency of compute resources consumed with minimal loss in time to solution.</p>

### Serverless HPC: Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Prospects for Accelerated Cloud Computing
<pre>🕥 Time: 10:30 a.m. – Noon   |   ℹ️ Event Type: Panel   |   📍 Location: <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=20&location=rB313B-B314" target="_blank">B313B-B314</a>   |   🔗 <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=pan108&sess=sess452" target="_blank">More details</a>   </pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: With the ongoing convergence of high-performance computing and cloud, HPC gains a chance to transform and improve its runtimes and programming models. HPC systems can increase their efficiency and accessibility by adapting elastic cloud paradigms, with the prime example being serverless computing. Serverless abstracts away resource management and introduces fine-grained allocations, allowing system operators to improve their efficiency with elastic containers (CaaS), functions (FaaS), and acceleration (XaaS). However, adopting serverless technologies brings challenges that have not been treated adequately in HPC: security of multi-tenant deployments, portability, and performance isolation in shared resources.

In this interactive panel, experts from academia and national labs will debate how serverless can support the rigorous demands of HPC applications. They will share experiences of introducing elastic programming models into the rigid world of high-performance systems and outline predictions for the future: Will serverless schedulers become first-class citizens on HPC systems?</p>

### IRI: What Novel Interfaces Will HPC Expose for Cross-Facility Workflows?
<pre>🕛 Time: 12:15 – 1:15 p.m.   |   ℹ️ Event Type: BOF   |   📍 Location: <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=20&location=rB311" target="_blank">B311</a>   |   🔗 <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=bof218&sess=sess670" target="_blank">More details</a>   </pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: DOE has recently launched the Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) program, which is designed to enable new modes of integrated science across DOE user facilities. Common or unified interfaces are needed for these workflows to seamlessly orchestrate resources across high-performance computing, data, and network providers. These interfaces could be REST APIs for programmable workflows, expansive UIs like JupyterLab, or deep integration with external workflow orchestrators.

This BoF will summarize the current efforts of the IRI interfaces working group and individual ASCR user facilities to develop new interfaces. We invite the community to provide feedback to help guide these IRI efforts.</p>

### Establishing a High-Performance and Productive Ecosystem for Distributed Execution of Python Functions Using Globus Compute
<pre>🕣 Time: 8:40 – 9:10 a.m.   |   ℹ️ Event Type: Workshop   |   📍 Location: <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=20&location=rB311" target="_blank">B311</a>   |   🔗 <a href="https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=ws_hust105&sess=sess771" target="_blank">More details</a>   </pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Democratizing access to the research computing ecosystem is critical for accelerating research progress. However, the gap between a high-level workload, such as Python in a Jupyter notebook, and the resources exposed by HPC systems is significant. Users must securely authenticate, manage network connections, deploy and manage software, provision and configure nodes, and manage workload execution. Globus Compute reduces these barriers by providing a managed, fire-and-forget model that enables execution of Python functions across any resource to which a user has access. In this paper we describe enhancements to Globus Compute that further reduce barriers to use of the research computing ecosystem: an asynchronous, future-based executor interface for submitting and monitoring tasks, shell and MPI-based function types, and a multi-user endpoint that can be deployed by administrators and used by authorized users.</p>
