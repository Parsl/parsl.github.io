	<p>By popular demand, our Friday afternoon session will be a skill enhancement opportunity called 🍄 Level Up – an advanced session led by Ben Clifford that dives deeper into Parsl's codebase. This session, aimed at Parsl power users, will consist of six 25-minute sessions that focus on the following topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Running a task: from app definition to an htex worker and back again</li>
		<li>Getting objects to workers: pickle, with an emphasis on common Parsl problems such as (un)installed packages, functions and exceptions</li>
		<li>Blocks: batch systems, providers, launchers, scaling</li>
		<li>Elaborating tasks: dependencies, retries, checkpointing, file staging, join_apps</li>
		<li>Understanding the monitoring database</li>
		<li>Plugging your own code into Parsl. How and why?</li>
	</ul>
